# Text to File Downloader

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Text to File Downloader is a simple, efficient web application that allows users to convert and download text as a .txt file. Built with Next.js and React, this tool provides a seamless experience for users who need to quickly save text content as a downloadable file.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Features

- **Easy-to-use Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for effortless text-to-file conversion.
- **Instant Download**: Convert and download text as a .txt file with a single click.
- **No File Size Limit**: Process large amounts of text (performance may vary for very large inputs).
- **Client-side Processing**: All text conversion happens in the browser, ensuring data privacy.
- **Mobile-friendly**: Fully functional on mobile devices.
